This is a beta/testing release of my Batch OS project.
There are not many features currently, and there are quite a few bugs. However, the code still is in useable condition, so I thought that I would let some people test it out.
Also, GitHub removed the empty directories which it needs to run, so you'll have to create `home`, `tmp`, and `usr`. I'll fix that eventually I guess ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
